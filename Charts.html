			In an annual report, compiled by UCLA's College of Social Science, diversity in media has shown substantial gains across the board but still falls short in reflecting rapid demographic shifts in the U.S.

	<p>As of <a herf="https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2014-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2-12-14.pdf">2011-2012</a>, minorities accounted for 36.3% of the U.S. population, in <a herf="hhttps://socialsciences.ucla.edu/hollywood-diversity-report-2019/">2017-2018</a>, minorities accounted for 39.4% of the U.S. population. Over the last few years, gains have been made in every area of broadcast, with the biggest gains being seen in lead actors in the broadcast scripted category. According to UCLA's College of Social Science's Hollywood Diversity Report, over the last 6 years, minorities as leads in comedy and drama scripted broadcasts jumped from 7 to 1 in this area to 2 to 1, taking a 21.5% share up from 5.1% in 2011-2012.

	Gains were also notably made in broadcast reality which jumped from a 15.4% share to 28.4% share. The 2017-2018 report notes that minorities in reality television have become something of a standard in reality television. This division of television has seen a steady climb over the last 6 years with its biggest jump occurring between the 2013-2014 season and the 2014-2015 season, jumping from 16.7% to 24% and seeing a nearly 2% point jump each subsequent television season.

	Digital television also saw a large jump between the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 season, going from 12.9% to 21.3%. In the 2011-2012 season, the report lumped digital and syndicated television together giving the category a 21% share in minority leads, but leaving out data that solely reflects minorities leads on digital platforms. The report noted that despite these gains, this division like the others in media, "would have to nearly double" to meet the diversity seen in the U.S.
